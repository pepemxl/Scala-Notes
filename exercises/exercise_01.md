1. Compute the steps to transform an anagram only using `character swaps`

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters in a word to produce another word, eg. `hola` becomes `alho`. Find the steps to transform this anagram, eg. `hola` -> `hoal` -> `haol` -> `ahol` -> `ahlo` -> `alho`.

There may be multiple solutions to each rearrangement.
